Receiver: effects
Possible Messages:
	chorus on <float>			
	chorus rate <float>			> 0, frequency in Hz					
	chorus depth <float>												
	chorus mix <float>				 									

	tremolo on <float> 			0 or 1
	tremolo rate <float> 		> 0, frequency in Hz					
	tremolo depth <float> 		usually 0 to 1, can be any number		
	tremolo shape <float> 		0 - sine, 
								1 - sawtooth, 
								2 - reverse sawtooth, 
								3 - square

	delay on <float> 			0 or 1
	delay feedback <float>		from 0 to 1 							
	delay time <float> 			time in ms 								
	delay amount <float> 		0 to 1, can be any number 				

	ringmod on <float> 			0 or 1
	ringmod rate <float> 		> 0, frequency in Hz 					
	ringmod depth <float> 		0 to 1 									
	ringmod rate mod <float>	Set mod range
	ringmod depth mod <float>	Set mod range

	filter on <float> 			0 or 1
	filter frequency <float> 	> 40 and < 22000 - frequency in Hz 		
	filter resonance <float> 	> 0, usually from 0 to ~20  			
	filter gain <float> 		Any number								
	filter type <symbol>		"lowpass", 		// No effect from Gain
								"bandpass", 	// No effect from Gain
								"highpass",		// No effect from Gain
								"notch", 		// No effect from Gain
								"peak", 		// Gain effects this
								"highshelf", 	// Gain effects this
								"lowshelf",		// Gain effects this

	pan <float> 				0 to 1, 
								0 is left, 
								1 is right, 
								.5 is equal in both speakers 

	volume <float> 				same as gain, but only from 0 to 1

Note Interface:

Patches:

	wavetable_synth.pd
	sampler.pd  		// Not yet implemented, use wavetable_synth.pd for now

// Send two floats for note-on & note-off
Receiver: $0-note 
Possible messages:  

	<list> 						(key, velocity) pair as a list, both from 0 to 127
	pitchbend <float>
	pitchbend_range <float>
	adsr <list>					"attack, decay, sustain, release",  
	waveform <symbol>			name of waveform. see bottom for names. takes format: <name>_table 
	flush <bang>				sends note-off to all notes
	print 						Prints adsr note-on & offs in Pd - debugging

Receiver: $0-effects
Possible messages (all lists):

	filter frequency <float> 	> 40 and < 22000 - frequency in Hz 		
								Lowpass filter
								Filter is always on, frequency of 22000 means no effect

	volume <float> 				same as gain, but only from 0 to 1
